# obj2kh2v
Model importer for Kingdom Hearts 2

It's as dirty as it can get and doesn't even include VU1 assembler
for now but eh, it kinda works.

Oh btw when I mean it kinda works datas are roughly placed, I just made the
tool in a day. It is still missing some unpack
commands and all, just figured I would upload this before I lose it

Good luck for understanding the code btw, should stop working
with vim on 135x10(I'm using a terminal embedded in my file manager, dolphin)
